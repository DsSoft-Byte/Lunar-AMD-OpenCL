# Lunar-AMD-OpenCL
The Fortnite Lunar aimbot using YoloV5 with AMD OpenCL and Nvidia Cuda compatibility

The AMD OpenCL option is already loaded by default, to use CUDA with more FPS rename aimbot.py in the lib folder ro aimbotamd.py and rename aimbotnvda.py to aimbot, so the nvidia aimbot gets loaded instead.

Setup as always with pip install -r requirements.txt

Only supports python 3.10
